\subsection{Checking the experimental assumption}

Since the two prompts are randomly sent out to business, we have excellent balance across observable co-variates as shown in \autoref{tab:balance}.

In addition, to guard against concerns that the treatment prompt may be politically sensitive, I also check and confirm that firms with the treatment form does not have a different non-response rate ($\textbf{p-value} = 0.12$).

Finally, to guard against systematic bias in non-response, I check the co-variate balance between firms that responded and those that did not in \autopageref{tab:balance_response}. The results suggest some issues with co-variate balance: firms with educated CEOs and CEOs with former ties to state businesses respond slightly more. This means that the population observed in the experiment may be different, leading to difficulty in generalizing our ATE (average treatment effect) to PATE (population average treatment effect). However, educated businessmen with political ties are precisely the group most likely to be co-opted, this is in fact the group that we should pay most attention to. Therefore, while our treatment effect may not generalize to ordinary Vietnamese businessman, it does comport with the focus of our study on political elites.
