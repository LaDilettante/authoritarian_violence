\subsection{Checking the experimental assumption}

Since the two prompts are randomly sent out to business, we have excellent balance across observable co-variates as shown in \autoref{tab:balance}.

In addition, to guard against concerns that this question may be politically sensitive, leading to systematic bias in non-response, I also check and confirm that firms with the treatment form does not have a different non-response rate ($\textbf{p-value} = 0.12$).
